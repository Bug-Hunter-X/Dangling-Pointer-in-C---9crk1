This repository demonstrates a common C++ error involving dangling pointers.  The `bug.cpp` file contains code that attempts to delete a pointer to a stack variable, which is incorrect and results in undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.cpp` demonstrates the corrected approach.  This is a fundamental issue for C++ developers to understand to avoid memory leaks and program crashes.
